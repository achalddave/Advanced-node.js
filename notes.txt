Package.json
============
It's a way to make sure everyone who uses your stuff has 
the proper modules.

`npm init`
    Just use the defaults
    You get something like package.json in package.jsonStart commit
    npm install [module] --save
    npm install -d 
        installs all the dependencies from package.json! :)

    npm publish
        publishes your package to npm repo! 
            all you need is the package.json
